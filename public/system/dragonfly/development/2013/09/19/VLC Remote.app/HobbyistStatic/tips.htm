<h2>Start automatically with your favourite remote</h2>
<p>You'll need to use a saved remote for this one. Tap on the 'Add computer' and add the remote that you want to use. </p>
<p>Now just select the 'Use as default remote' option. </p>
<p>When you run VLC remote, it will automatically switch to this remote as soon as VLC is detected running on that machine. <br />
</p>
<h2>Access Fullscreen from the main page</h2>
<p>Turning on fullscreen mode when watching movies is really handy. You can do that with the icon in the main remote page. It's the one that looks like four arrows point outwards. <br />
  </p>
<h2>How to set the default directory for browsing</h2>
<p>(requires paid version) <br />
  This will only work on a saved remote, so make sure you add the computer you want to control as a saved remote (press 'add computer' then follow the prompts). <br />
  Open the remote and browse to the directory you want as a default. <br />
  Press the 'default' button and your new default is set. </p>
<p>If you exit VLC remote, then launch it again, you'll start browsing in this directory. <br />
  </p>
<h2>How to access external drives</h2>
<p>(requires paid version) </p>
<p>Unfortunately, VLC doesn't recognise aliases or shortcuts (it just tries to play them), so these won't help you. </p>
<p>However you can access your external drives. <br />
  Windows: Just hit the up button until you get to the top of the browsing tree. You should see your drives listed there. If not, then you'll need to make sure that your external drive is mapped to a drive letter. <br />
  Mac: Navigate to the top directory (just hit the up button until you get there) then look in 'Volumes'. You should see external drives there. </p>
<p>tip: you can set your external drive as your default directory to make browsing faster in future. <br />
 </p>
<h2>Add a whole folder to your playlist</h2>
<p>(requires paid version) </p>
<p>just tap on the 'play icon' next to the folder and all its contents will be added to the playlist.</p>
