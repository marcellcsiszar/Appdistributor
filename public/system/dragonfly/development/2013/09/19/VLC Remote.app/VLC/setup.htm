<p>Thank you for using VLC Remote. Setting up the link between the remote and your VLC player will take just a few steps and a few minutes. </p>
<p>1) Make sure that you have turned on the http remote interface in your VLC Player and enabled access.</p>
<p>Please go to http://www.hobbyistsoftware.com/VLCSetup.php on the computer running VLC for step by step instructions (this will take a few minutes) </p>
<p>2)  Let VLC Remote know where your player is.</p>
<p>Normally, you can just hit 'ReScan' and VLC Remote will automatically find nearby computers.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you see a traffic cone next to a computer, then everything is ready to go. Just tap on the computer and your remote will fire up. </li>
  </ul>
<p>otherwise:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you see a traffic cone with an X through it, then VLC has got the http interface running, but is not allowing your iPhone to get access</li>
  <li>If you don't see any icon by your computer, then VLC is not running the http interface</li>
  <li>If you don't see your computer listed, then you will need to tell VLC remote the address of your computer.</li>
  </ul>
<p>For each of these cases, please go to http://www.hobbyistsoftware.com/VLCSetup.php for instructions on how to sort things out (it shouldn't take long) </p>
<p>If you have any feedback or comments, please let me know at  <a href="mailto:Rob@hobbyistsoftware.com">Rob@hobbyistsoftware.com</a></p>
