<p>The remote address lets VLC Remote know where to contact your computer that is running VLC. </p>
<p>If you know how your network is setup, then you can use your computer name on the network. This might be something like 'RobMac.HomeRouter' or just 'RobMac'. </p>
<p>If you don't know how your network is set up, then simply open http:www.HobbyistSoftware.com/ip.php on your computer (not your iPhone) and it should show you what your local IP address is. This will be something like '192.168.1.10'.</p>
<p>You can then enter the ip address into the 'Remote Address' field.</p>
